# BradleyTerryScalable

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable)

An R package for fitting the Bradley-Terry model to pair-comparison data, to enable statistically principled ranking of a potentially large number of objects.

**Note: this package is currently in the final stages of development.  Some changes are likely in the user interface and documentation, especially, prior to the package's scheduled initial submission to CRAN in early June 2017.**
