# BradleyTerryScalable

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable)

An R package for fitting the Bradley-Terry model to pair-comparison data, to enable statistically principled ranking of a potentially large number of objects.

**Note: this package is currently in the final stages of development.  Some changes are likely in the user interface and documentation, especially, prior to the package's scheduled initial submission to CRAN in early June 2017.**

**Update on June 2nd: Very almost there! A few final tweaks and tidying to do, plus some improvements to the documentation, but we're getting close. **
